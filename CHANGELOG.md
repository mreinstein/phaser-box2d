* remove `b2GetOwnerTransform`
* `b2Body_GetInertiaTensor` -> `b2Body_GetRotationalInertia`
* `b2DistanceJoint_GetHertz` -> `b2DistanceJoint_GetSpringHertz`

## Version 1.1.0 - December 30th 2024

* The `b2CastOutput` function now takes two `b2Vec` instances, `rayPoint` and `rayNormal`. These are now passed in from locally cached values where-ever `b2ShapeCast` is called. This prevents a crash when `b2TransformPoint` is called on the `output.point` which was previously null.
* Renamed smooth segment to chain segment as per #783 (https://github.com/erincatto/box2d/pull/783)
    * `b2CollideSmoothSegmentAndPolygon` -> `b2CollideChainSegmentAndPolygon`
    * `b2CollideSmoothSegmentAndCapsule` -> `b2CollideChainSegmentAndCapsule`
    * `b2CollideSmoothSegmentAndCircle` -> `b2CollideChainSegmentAndCircle`
    * `b2SmoothSegment` -> `b2ChainSegment`
    * `b2Shape.smoothSegment` -> `b2Shape.chainSegment` and the type has changed from `b2SmoothSegment` to `b2ChainSegment`
    * `b2_smoothSegmentShape` -> `b2_chainSegmentShape`
    ` `b2Shape_GetSmoothSegment` -> `b2Shape_GetChainSegment`
* Fix for skipped shape in ray cast callback (returning -1) (https://github.com/erincatto/box2d/commit/bcc834bc1dd07b2387aca5fa4cbbb34f612a2e72)
* Removed unused automatic mass functions:
    * `b2Body_SetAutomaticMass` function removed
    * `b2Body_GetAutomaticMass` function removed
    * `b2Body.automaticMass` property renamed to `b2Body.updateBodyMass`
* `b2_huge` renamed to `B2_HUGE`
* `b2_maxWorlds` renamed to `B2_MAX_WORLDS`
* `b2_maxRotation` renamed to `B2_MAX_ROTATION`
* `b2_pi` renamed to `B2_PI`
* `b2_defaultMaskBits` renamed to `B2_DEFAULT_MASK_BITS`
* `b2_maxPolygonVertices` renamed to `B2_MAX_POLYGON_VERTICES`
* `b2_defaultCategoryBits` renamed to `B2_DEFAULT_CATEGORY_BITS`
* `b2_treeStackSize` renamed to `B2_TREE_STACK_SIZE`

## Box2D Upstream Checklist

✔️ = The upstream commit is 100% integrated  
🔎 = The upstream commit hasn't yet been looked at  
💻 = The upstream commit has been partially integrated  

When converting a commit it's at your discretion if you want to include the asserts and/or comments from upstream. In some cases, they can be useful (which is why they're in some areas of the current code), but they're computationally expensive for testing. The production build strips them out, the dev build does not.

We're happy to consider a commit as fully completed even if it has asserts or comments not moved over. Matching the API 1:1 is more important.
